<h2> class="blog-post-title">Lobster Casting Tutorial</h2>
<p>This lab simulates a lobster's odor gated rheotaxis behavior on the iRobot Create. This behavior includes 
moving toward the mean odor flow when food odor is detected, casting randomly to the left and right when 
food odor is lost, and stopping when food is found.</p>
<h3>Translating lobster casting to a skid steering ground robot</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sensors. A lobster uses its sense of smell to detect 
approaching food and determine its direction. For the 
Creates, we will use the array of four downward facing IR 
sensors at the front of each robot (Figure 1). These 
sensors are actually cliff-sensors, meant to detect when 
the robot is about to move off an edge (such as stairs). 
However, they are sensitive enough that they can be used 
to read the infrared reflectivity of the ground. In this way, 
the robot can distinguish different surfaces/materials by 
their IR reading. Since they are spaced along the front of 
the robot, they can also determine direction.</li>
<li>Food and Odor. Since we are using IR sensors to 
distinguish different surfaces/materials, we only need 
three distinct materials to represent the water the 
robot is in, the odor of food, and the food itself. For 
this lab, the water is represented by brown butcher paper. 
The odor is marked by black marks on the butcher paper. 
And the food is marked by a piece of aluminum foil. These 
have distinct enough IR reflectivity to be distinguished by 
the Create's IR sensors.

<li> Flowing water. A lobster searching for food stands 
relatively still facing upstream, allowing water to flow past 
it and thus detect food odor and move to intercept the 
food. For the Creates, the best approximation is to 
constantly move upstream on the butcher paper, and 
move left and right when appropriate.</li>
