<h2 class="blog-post-title">Lobster Casting Tutorial</h2>
<p>This lab simulates a lobster's odor gated rheotaxis behavior on the iRobot Create. This behavior includes 
moving toward the mean odor flow when food odor is detected, casting randomly to the left and right when 
food odor is lost, and stopping when food is found.</p>
<h3>Translating lobster casting to a skid steering ground robot</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sensors. A lobster uses its sense of smell to detect 
approaching food and determine its direction. For the 
Creates, we will use the array of four downward facing IR 
sensors at the front of each robot. These 
sensors are actually cliff-sensors, meant to detect when 
the robot is about to move off an edge (such as stairs). 
However, they are sensitive enough that they can be used 
to read the infrared reflectivity of the ground. In this way, 
the robot can distinguish different surfaces/materials by 
their IR reading. Since they are spaced along the front of 
the robot, they can also determine direction.</li>
<li>Food and Odor. Since we are using IR sensors to 
distinguish different surfaces/materials, we only need 
three distinct materials to represent the water the 
robot is in, the odor of food, and the food itself. For 
this lab, the water is represented by brown butcher paper. 
The odor is marked by black marks on the butcher paper. 
And the food is marked by a piece of aluminum foil. These 
have distinct enough IR reflectivity to be distinguished by 
the Create's IR sensors.

</p>
</li>
<li> Flowing water. A lobster searching for food stands 
relatively still facing upstream, allowing water to flow past 
it and thus detect food odor and move to intercept the 
food. For the Creates, the best approximation is to 
constantly move upstream on the butcher paper, and 
move left and right when appropriate.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Hit the run button.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Program Explanation</h3>
<p>
The main concepts used in this tutorial that have not 
been used in previous tutorials, are sub VIs and global 
variables. Sub VIs are VIs that can be reused and have 
their own inputs and outputs. For a tutorial on creating 
sub VIs go <a href="http://www.ni.com/tutorial/7593/en/">here</a>. 
Global variables are variables that can be shared between VIs. 
For a more thourough explanation of global varibles go

here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The program has been designed using the concepts of 
behavioral based robotics. There are three behaviors:
<ul>
  <li>cast - searching for an odor</li>
  <li>find_food - finding the location of the food</li>
  <li>move_upstream - moving up the water stream</li>
</ul>
To support these behaviors there is a Motor Schema and 
Perceptual Schema. The Motor Schema consists of the methods:
<ul>
  <li>locomote - input a direction and output motor commands</li>
</ul>
The Perceptual Schema includes:
<ul>
  <li>detect_food - determine if we sense food</li>
  <li>detect_mean_flow - determine if the food is on the left or the right</li>
  <li>detect_odor - determine if we sense an odor</li>
  <li>random - generate a random string of LEFT or RIGHT</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The program makes use of many global variables. These variables are 
shown below and can be found in the global_varibles.vi file:
</p>
<p><img src="/images/lobster-casting/global_variables_vi.PNG" style="max-width:100%;" /></p>
<p>
The variables on the left are used internally by the 
program and should not be changed. The variables on the 
right are input paramaters to the program. These can and 
should be adjusted as the IR threshold will change depending 
on the lighting of the room.
</p>
<p>
The program starts in lobster_casting.vi, the rest of the VIs are used 
as sub VIs. The lobster_casting.vi takes as input the UART port from 
the myRIO that the iRobot is connected to. In our case it will be 
ALSR1. As output we see if the robot has found food and a general 
status as well as any errors. The VI block diagram is shown below:

</p>
<p>
The basic job of the lobster_casting VI is to call the find_food VI. 
The find_food VI loops until either food is found or an exit condidition 
is reached. The find_food VI is shown below:
