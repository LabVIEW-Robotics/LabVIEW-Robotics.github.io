<h2 class="blog-post-title">Teleoperation Tutorial</h2>
<p>Combining the myRIO, the iRobot Create, and the NI Vision module makes it 
possible to create a teleoperated robot. This tutorial will walk through creating 
such a robot. The items you will need are listed below:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>iRobot Create</li>
<li><a href="http://www.labview.com/myrio/">myRIO 1900 Series</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-webcam-c310?crid=34">USB Webcam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8287">25 Pin Male Soderable Cup</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11476">5.5mm/2.1mm DC Barrel Jack Connector</a>
<li>Breadboarding Wire</li>
</ul>
Make sure you have went through all the setup steps in the previous tutorials 
especially the parts pertaining to installing the modules, as the VI will not compile 
without all the neccessary modules. The modules you will need are listed below:
<ul>
<li>NI Vision</li>
<li>myRIO Software Suite</li>
<li>iRobot Create Package</li>
</ul>
You also need to make sure you have installed the IMAQ drivers onto the myRIO to be 
able to use a USB webcam.
</p>
<h2 class="blog-post-title">Hardware Setup</h2>
<p>The 25 pin male soderable cup will be used as an interface between the iRobot create and 
the myRIO; it will also be used to provide power to the myRIO. The pins are shown below.

</p>
To set up the connections between the 25 pin connector and the myRIO follow the steps below:
<ol>
<li>First we will set up the power connection. Solder two inch length red wires onto pins 
10, 11, and 12; connect all three of these wires to the DC barrel jack hot(red) wire. 
Solder the ground(black) wire from the DC barrel jack to pin 25 of the 25 pin male 
soderable cup. The barrel jack connection, shown below, when plugged into the iRobot 
create will be used to power the myRIO.

</p>
</li>
<li>
Next we will set up the connections for communication between the myRIO and the Create. 
This will require four wires of approximately twelve inches in length 
used for the Rx, Tx, power, and ground lines of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication">serial</a> connection. 
These four wires will need to be soldered to the pins 1, 2, 8, and 15 of the 25 pin 
connector. 
</li>
<li>
Take the 25 pin connector and plug it into the cargo bay of the iRobot create.

</p>
</li>
<li>
The myRIO kit comes with an expansion port breakout board. We will use this to 
make the serial connection. Plug in the expansion port breakout and make the following 
connections:<br>
1 -> Tx<br>
2 -> Rx<br>
8 -> 5V<br>
14 -> GND<br>

</p>
</li>
<li>
Plug the USB camera into the USB port on the myRIO.
</li>
<li>
Finally, plug the barrel jack connector into the power jack on the myRIO.
</li>
</ol>
