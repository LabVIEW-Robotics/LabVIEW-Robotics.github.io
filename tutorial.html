<h2 class="blog-post-title">Teleoperation Tutorial</h2>
<p>Combining the myRIO, the iRobot Create, and the NI Vision module makes it 
possible to create a teleoperated robot. This tutorial will walk through creating 
such a robot. The items you will need are listed below:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>iRobot Create</li>
<li><a href="http://www.labview.com/myrio/">myRIO 1900 Series</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-webcam-c310?crid=34">USB Webcam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8287">25 Pin Male Soderable Cup</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11476">5.5mm/2.1mm DC Barrel Jack Connector</a>
<li>Breadboarding Wire</li>
</ul>
Make sure you have went through all the setup steps in the previous tutorials 
especially the parts pertaining to installing the modules, as the VI will not compile 
without all the neccessary modules. The modules you will need are listed below:
<ul>
<li>NI Vision</li>
<li>myRIO Software Suite</li>
<li>iRobot Create Package</li>
</ul>
You also need to make sure you have installed the IMAQ drivers onto the myRIO to be 
able to use a USB webcam. The time required to complete the setup portion of this tutorial 
is approximately one hour for each robot being setup. This includes creating the 
connectors and installing all the NI Software from scratch for each computer. 
Make sure to have administrative priviledges on the computers or you will not be 
able to install the software.
</p>
<h2 class="blog-post-title">Hardware Setup</h2>
<p>The 25 pin male soderable cup will be used as an interface between the iRobot create and 
the myRIO; it will also be used to provide power to the myRIO. The pins are shown below. 
<p>

</p>
To set up the connections between the 25 pin connector and the myRIO follow the steps below:
<ol>
<li>First we will set up the power connection. Solder two inch length red wires onto pins 
10, 11, and 12; connect all three of these wires to the DC barrel jack hot(red) wire. 
Solder the ground(black) wire from the DC barrel jack to pin 25 of the 25 pin male 
soderable cup. The barrel jack connection, shown below, when plugged into the iRobot 
create will be used to power the myRIO. 
<p>

<img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/images/power_connection_close.jpg" />
</p>
</li>
<li>
Next we will set up the connections for communication between the myRIO and the Create. 
This will require four wires of approximately twelve inches in length 
used for the Rx, Tx, power, and ground lines of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication">serial</a> connection. 
These four wires will need to be soldered to the pins 1, 2, 8, and 15 of the 25 pin 
connector. 
</li>
<li>
Take the 25 pin connector and plug it into the cargo bay of the iRobot create.
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="/images/irobot_bay.jpg" />
</p>
</li>
<li>
The myRIO kit comes with an expansion port breakout board. We will use this to 
make the serial connection. Plug in the expansion port breakout and make the following 
connections:<br>
1 -> Tx<br>
2 -> Rx<br>
8 -> 5V<br>
14 -> GND<br>
<p>
<img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/images/myrio_serial.jpg" />
</p>
</li>
<li>
Plug the USB camera into the USB port on the myRIO.
</li>
<li>
Finally, plug the barrel jack connector into the power jack on the myRIO.
</li>
</ol>

</p>
</p>
<h2 class="blog-post-title">Software</h2>
<p>The robot system sends camera images over wifi to a LabVIEW front end 
running on a laptop. The front end also has sliders to control the speed 
and direction of the robot. The VI itself is compiled and ran on the myRIO. 
Befor getting started, make sure the myRIO is being powered by the 
iRobot Create and is connected to wifi. The steps below are used to 
setup the software portion of the tutorial:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Open LabVIEW and select Create new project. Using the create project 
wizard, create a new myRIO project.
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="/images/myrio_project.PNG" />
</p>
Open NI Max and find the IP address of the myRIO. Enter this IP address 
into the project wizard for the specific IP address or hostname. Finish 
the project creation wizard.
</li>
<li>
Download the "create_control" VI <a href="/create_control.vi">here</a>. 
In the project view right click the myRIO and select add -> file. 
Navigate to the downloaded VI and add it to the project.
</li>
<li>
Open the VI. Under the "Session In" dropdown select the camera which should 
be labeled cam1 or cam0. Under the "VISA resource name" dropdown select 
ASLR1.
</li>
<li>
Select the run button on the front panel and you should see the video feed 
from the robot. The speed and direction sliders should make the robot move.
<p>

</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2 class="blog-post-title">Block Diagram Explanation</h2>
<p>
The VI block diagram consists of four inputs from the front panel, the 
camera session, VISA resource name, speed, and direction. The camera session selects 
which camera on the myRIO to communicate with, the VISA resource 
name selects which serial port on the myRIO to use, the speed determines 
how fast forward or backward the robot should drive, and direction 
turns the robot left or right. The block diagram is shown below.
</p>
<p>
<img style="max-width:100%;" src="/images/vi_block_diagram.PNG" />
</p>
<p>
As shown in the block diagram, there are three control loops running in 
parallel. One loop to take the speed and direction input and convert it 
into speeds for the left and right wheel saving the values to a local variable. 
Another loop to read the left wheel and right wheel variables and 
execute a locomotion command to the iRobot Create. The third loop 
displays a live feed of the camera. Each loop has a seperate stop 
control button.
