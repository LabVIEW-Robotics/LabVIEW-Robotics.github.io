<h2 class="blog-post-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This page consists of frequent questions from students.</p>
<h3>How do I connect the myRIO to another device on the network?</h3>
<p>Communicating with another network device depends on the protocol 
being used. Fortunately LabVIEW supports many different protocols. To 
access these protocols, look under the data communication section of the 
block diagram functions.</p>

<p>
A tutorial on using the TCP protocol in LabVIEW can be found on 
the National Instruments website 
<a href="http://www.ni.com/white-paper/2710/en/">here</a>. Similarly an 
tutorial using UDP can be found <a href="http://www.ni.com/tutorial/4950/en/">here</a>.

<h3>What is the difference between running the VI on the host machine and the myRIO?</h3>
<p>Running a VI on the myRIO gives the VI access to the myRIO's ports. While running 
it on the host machine will give it access to the host machine ports. For example, 
if you want to read from a camera connected to the USB port on the myRIO 
you would want to run the VI on the myRIO. If the USB camera is connected to 
a USB port on the host machine then you would want to run it on the host machine.
</p>
<p>
Specifying if the VI will run on the host machine or the myRIO is done 
in the project view window. Right click on the target and select new -> VI. 
For more information you can also watch the instructional videos 
<a href="http://www.ni.com/academic/students/learn-rio/embedded-programming/">here</a>. 
While these videos were made for the cRIO they are also applicable to the myRIO.

<h3>How does a VI on the host machine talk to a VI on the myRIO?</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>How do I remove the lag from the camera output?</h3>
<p>
Communicating with the myRIO over the network will 
introduce a bandwidth constraint. This causes high definition 
video output to lag. One way to reduce this lag is to lower the 
resolution of the video aquisition. This can be done in the 
vision aquistion wizard on the Configure Aquisition Settings pane. 
Change the Video Mode setting to a lower resolution.
