<h2 class="blog-post-title">Web Services</h2>
<p>This tutorial will walk you through 
setting up a web page to display data 
from LabVIEW. This tutorial uses a 
computer, but using a myRIO should be 
very similar.</p>
<h2 class="blog-post-title">Software</h2>
<p>The project for this tutorial can 
be downloaded <a href="/Web.zip">here</a>. 
When set up and running correctly, the 
project will display a webpage that 
displays images from your webcam.</p>
<p>The project includes a computer target 
this target has a WebService.</p>
<p><img src="/images/web/project.PNG" style="max-width:100%;" /></p>
<p>To run your website, right click the WebService 
choose Application Web Server -> Publish. Open a browser 
goto localhost:8080/WebService.</p>
<p>Creating a VI under Web Resources 
adds either a GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE 
method page. You can use shared variables 
to communicate between other VIs. The ESP 
variables are used to pass the shared variable 
to the webcam.esp script. ESP scripts basically work 
as dynamic web generation.</p>
