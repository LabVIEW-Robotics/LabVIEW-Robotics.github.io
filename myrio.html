<h2 class="blog-post-title">MyRIO</h2>
<p>The National Instruments MyRIO is a portable embedded device similar to a Rasberry Pi 
or Arduino. It comes with a built in accelerometer and wifi capabilities, as well as many 
I/O ports and LEDs. This page will briefly describe getting started with the MyRIO and 
running an example program to display output from the accelerometer.</p>
<h2 class="blog-post-title">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The MyRIO ships with installation CDs for installing the necessary LabVIEW software and the 
drivers for connecting to the device. Once the software is installed LabVIEW will have 
a new category of functions labeled myRIO.</p>

</p>
<p>The box also includes instructions on 
making sure your device is working properly. Once you have setup your device
and confirmed it is functioning properly move on to the accelerometer example.</p>
<h2 class="blog-post-title">Accelerometer Example</h2>
<p>The MyRIO installation will make it possible to create LabVIEW projects from a MyRIO template. 
This template opens with an accelerometer VI. The VI displays the readings for the X, Y, and Z 
planes of the built in accelerometer. The front panel of the example VI is shown below.</p>

<p>
The block diagram for the VI is shown below.

</p>
<p>
The VI leaves space to add initialization functions of your own. By default there is simply 
an error handling variable. The accelerometer is read each iteration of the loop, bundled 
by a cluster function, and displayed on the waveform chart. When the stop button is pressed, 
the loop exits and the MyRIO resets.
</p>
<h2 class="blog-post-title">Connecting To Wifi</h2>
<p>The myRIO has a built in wifi connection capability. The following link is a video 
walkthrough showing how to connect the myRIO to wifi: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWIcR0Wxpuk">Wifi Video</a> 
If connecting to the A&M TAMU-LINK WPA network you will need to manually add the client certificate 
found here: <a href="http://www.lan.kth.se/eduroam/AddTrust_External_CA_Root.der">http://www.lan.kth.se/eduroam/AddTrust_External_CA_Root.der</a> 
After the device is connected to wifi it is given an IP address on the network it is connected to. Use this IP address 
when starting a new project to connect to the device.</p>

<h2 class="blog-post-title">Using a Webcam</h2>
<p>The myRIO can connect to USB webcams connected to the built in USB port. This functionality is not 
supported out of the box but the myRIO can be configured so that it does work. The following video link 
is a walkthrough of how to install the NI Vision softare and IMAQ Vision drivers onto the myRIO:
